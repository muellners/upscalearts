This city wants to put me down , and kill me , I have been wandering around from that light to other lights on the street no one seems to care, only want to use each other, I have lost all hopes that is why live outside the city.

This city smells like piss, people are sick. Eats mashed patatoe , why do you need mashed patatoe.
