The Currents !
Have you ever experienced that second of rush, that feeling of blood flowing upward?
Something that seems to pass cold in the beginning and later BOOM-it explodes making you realize you are one of those who is living. Likewise the current that flows to give power to the dead, awakening it to life.
This painting talks about those currents in humans that have so many feelings encrypted within it. Like the passion, anger, excitement, sadness and happiness. Without the essence of these feel, would living be the same?
