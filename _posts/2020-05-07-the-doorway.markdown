Ignorance is a bliss! Always?
In life we take birth feeling whole until we have tasted the actual reality of our conscious working. Trying to ignore the law of change, sticking to that virtual feeling of feeling complete.
Completeness is not a subject limited to human company only. Itâ€™s all more about the intensity the missing parts hold.
The more intense, the larger the void.
Voids to some the unfulfilled dreams, to others the missing love.
To some the forgiveness, to others the stubborn memories.
Would you let the voids become a complete whole or a tangled loop!
Would you be able to ignore it? If yes!
Was ignorance really a bliss?
